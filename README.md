Adopting a framework means programming against a set of abstractions not designed for your application,
but for a "common use case". Using these abstractions does not require understanding their implementation details.
This can be a good thing. On the other hand, it robs developers of potential learning experiences.

This project lists a set of common patterns and features found in JS applications, and re-implements them in plain JS.
Partially as a learning experience for the author, partially as a demonstration that frameworks shouldn't be treated
as black boxes of dark magic.
